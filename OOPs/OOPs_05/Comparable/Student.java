/*
    By implementing Comparable, you gain:
        Natural Ordering: Define how objects should be ordered by default.
        Simplified Sorting: Easily sort collections of objects.
        Consistency: Maintain a consistent ordering logic throughout your application.
        Integration: Seamlessly integrate with Javaâ€™s collection classes and algorithms.
        Encapsulation: Keep comparison logic within the class, making it intuitive and maintainable.

    When a class implements 'Comparable', it must override the 'compareTo' method, which compares the current object with another object of the same type.
    It is a interface
